## LSP: our own client, not a package

Originally adopted **`pi-lsp-extension`** (MIT). It worked, but proved fragile in
four ways, all of which needed workarounds on our side:

1. A stale transitive import (`vscode-languageserver-protocol/node.js`, an export
   removed in 3.18) had to be pinned with an npm `override`.
2. Its language servers kept the process alive after the final turn, so `pi -p`
   **never exited**. We had to gate the whole extension off in one-shot runs,
   which meant no diagnostics there at all.
3. Its auto-append hook only fired when a server was *already* running, and
   servers started lazily on the first file **read** — so an edit as the first
   action of a session silently produced nothing.
4. Against TypeScript 7 (whose native compiler dropped `lib/tsserver.js`) the
   server failed and diagnostics **silently** degraded to tree-sitter syntax
   checks, with no signal that type checking was gone.

It also carried far more than we need: ~7000 lines and twelve tools, including
tree-sitter search, a workspace index, completions, and code actions. Claude Code
has **no** LSP tools — it only receives diagnostics after edits — so eleven of
those were beyond parity, and their schemas would crowd the prompt.

`extensions/lsp/` is now our own, ~600 lines with **zero dependencies**:
`protocol.ts` (Content-Length framing), `servers.ts` (language/server/root
detection, table taken from pi-lsp-extension), `client.ts` (spawn, initialize,
document sync, diagnostics), `format.ts` (rendering), `index.ts` (wiring).
Two behaviors only: error diagnostics appended to `edit`/`write` results, and a
deferred `lsp_diagnostics` tool. Adding hover or definition later is one
`client.request(...)` each.

Each fragility above is addressed by design:

- **No dependencies**, so no transitive protocol conflicts to pin.
- Child process and stdio handles are `unref`'d and shut down on
  `session_shutdown`, so one-shot runs exit — **the argv gate is gone and
  diagnostics now work in `-p` too**.
- Content is pushed with `didOpen`/`didChange` before every read, so an edit as
  the session's first action is covered, and answers reflect current content
  rather than whatever the server happened to cache.
- `getDiagnostics` awaits the server's next publish for that document (timeout
  plus last-known fallback) instead of sleeping a fixed interval.
- A TypeScript preflight detects the missing `tsserver.js` and returns a
  sentence explaining it, rather than degrading silently.

Diagnostics are still delivered in the tool result rather than through our
system-reminder queue: that is where the model needs them, and it costs one
delivery instead of two.

Verified end-to-end in one-shot mode: an edit introducing a type error appended
`src/index.ts:5:30 error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to
parameter of type 'string'. (2345) [typescript]` — matching `tsc` — the run
exited in 16s, no language-server processes leaked, the deferred tool loaded and
answered on demand, and a TypeScript 7 project returned the preflight
explanation.
